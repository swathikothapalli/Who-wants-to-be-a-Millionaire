Project Name: Who wants to be a Millionaire
Developers: GOWTHAM THATAVARTHI,  SANTOSHI KAVYA DUGGANA, SWATHI KOTHAPALLI.
About: This is an adaptation of the game show “Who wants to be a Millionaire”, which is very 		popular. The tech-stack used are HTML, CSS, PHP.
Game Rules:
•	You must register yourself to play the game.
•	Once registered, you can login and play the game anytime.
•	There are easy, medium and difficult levels in the game. Two questions for each level.
•	Each level has a question and 4 options. Questions are randomized for each user. There is only one right answer.
•	Upon submitting the correct option, you will be given the score and taken to the next level.
•	Upon submitting the wrong answer, your game will be terminated, you will be awarded the cash prize.
•	For every question, you can use a hint to seek the right answer. 
•	Every time the hint is used, your score will be halved.
•	Upon clearing the 6th Level, you will be awarded One Million Dollars.
•	You will be redirected to the Leader board page, once your game is finished or if you are terminated.
Highlights:
•	We used the common.php file, where we moved the redundant code as PHP functions which are used across all other pages. Moving redundant code saved us a lot of time. For example, having common nav bar included in common.php file.

•	We used the PHP random functions to change the order of questions every time a user starts the game, which makes a huge difference in game difficulty. We have set 3 difficulty levels easy, medium and high. 

•	Whenever a hint is used in answering, the score reduces by half. This feature helps equalize users' performance on the leaderboard.

•	Each user max score is updated in the leaderboard, making it more favorable to the user.

•	The filpcard CSS file is used to provide flip animation in game page which is quite different from other projects.
